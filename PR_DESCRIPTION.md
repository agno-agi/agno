## Summary

Fixed a critical bug where tool post-hooks were not executing when tool execution failed with an exception. Post-hooks are now guaranteed to execute regardless of success or failure, matching the documented behavior and enabling important use cases like cleanup, error logging, and retry logic.

**The Problem:**
- Post-hooks were called AFTER the try/except block
- When exceptions occurred, the code returned early from the except block
- Post-hook execution was skipped entirely on tool failures

**The Solution:**
- Moved post-hook execution into a `finally` block
- Post-hooks now execute regardless of success/failure
- `AgentRunException` is properly re-raised after post-hook execution
- Applied fix to both sync (`execute()`) and async (`aexecute()`) methods

This fix enables critical use cases that were previously broken:
- **Cleanup operations** - Release resources even when tools fail
- **Error logging** - Track and log tool failures
- **Metrics/monitoring** - Measure tool failure rates
- **Retry logic** - Implement retry mechanisms in post-hooks

(Related to the documented behavior at [function.py:95-97](libs/agno/agno/tools/function.py#L95-L97))

## Additional Notes

### Testing
- All 66 existing tests pass without modification (35 unit tests + 31 integration tests)
- Verified both sync and async execution paths
- Confirmed post-hooks execute on:
  - Regular exceptions (`ValueError`, `RuntimeError`, etc.)
  - `AgentRunException` (which is re-raised after post-hook)
  - Successful execution (existing behavior maintained)

### Code Changes
Files modified:
- `libs/agno/agno/tools/function.py`
  - `execute()` method (lines 776-850)
  - `aexecute()` method (lines 974-1058)

### Backward Compatibility
âœ… **Fully backward compatible** - All existing tests pass without modification. The change only fixes the bug where post-hooks weren't executing on failures.

### Related Cookbook Examples
The fix enables the retry logic example at `cookbook/tools/other/retry_tool_call_from_post_hook.py` to work correctly when tools throw exceptions.
