# REVIEW LOG

Generated: 2026-02-11 UTC (v2.5 three-layer review)

## Framework Issues

None specific to skills module.

## Cookbook Quality

[QUALITY] basic_skills.py — Good minimal example of the LocalSkills loader. Sample skills (git-workflow, code-review) are well-structured standalone scripts.

## Fixes Applied

None — cookbook is v2.5 compatible as-is.
