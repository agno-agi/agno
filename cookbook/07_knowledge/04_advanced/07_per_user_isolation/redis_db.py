"""
Per-User Knowledge Isolation with Redis
=======================================
Give each user a private view of one shared knowledge base. Documents a user
uploads are visible only to them; documents uploaded with no user are shared
with everyone, and an admin (no user id) sees all of it.

Redis does this by storing the owner as a tag field and filtering on it,
treating chunks with no tag as shared.

Setup: ./cookbook/scripts/run_redis.sh
