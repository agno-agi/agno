"""
Per-User Knowledge Isolation with SurrealDB
===========================================
Give each user a private view of one shared knowledge base. Documents a user
uploads are visible only to them; documents uploaded with no user are shared
with everyone, and an admin (no user id) sees all of it.

SurrealDB does this by storing the owner in a user_id field and filtering on it,
treating chunks with no owner as shared.

Setup: ./cookbook/scripts/run_surrealdb.sh
