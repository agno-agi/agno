# Question: This is my first pregnancy, how does maternity care work?
## How Millie’s maternity care works — at a glance

Millie provides midwifery-led maternity and gynecology care in a modern clinic setting with a collaborative care system that brings together Certified Nurse Midwives, OB-GYNs, MFMs, and other specialists. We support low-to-moderate risk pregnancies and offer all standard gynecologic services, including menopause care.

Maternity patients deliver at our health system partner, Alta Bates Hospital, where our CNMs have admitting privileges with 24x7 OB-GYN hospitalist backup, when more care is needed.

Millie maternity patients are connected with a Millie Guide – who are practicing doulas – for birth and postpartum readiness, while the Millie app provides robust education, 1:1 messaging support, and remote monitoring. In addition, Millie also offers prenatal classes, support groups, mental health counseling, lactation care, and more to support families through the pregnancy-to-parenthood journey.

Millie accepts all major Commercial PPO plans, HMO plans through Brown & Toland, and Medicaid plans through Alameda Alliance for Health.

# What is a Certified Nurse-Midwife (CNM)?
 Certified Nurse Midwives: 
* Are primary care providers for women throughout the lifespan, with a special emphasis on pregnancy, childbirth, and gynecologic and reproductive health. 
* Come from a background in nursing (RN) and have further obtained advanced graduate-level education in nurse-midwifery (MSN). 
* Provide independent, patient care while practicing collaboratively with provider counterparts, like physicians, anesthesiologists, social workers, registered nurses, and case managers to deliver safe, cost-effective care to healthy women and their families. 
* Have prescriptive authority in all 50 states and must pass a national certification examination and earn national certification as a certified nurse-midwife through the American Midwifery Certification Board (AMCB). 


# How is Midwifery care different than OB care?
Midwifery care involves a trusting relationship between the provider and pregnant person. Our care is individualized, family centered and your pregnancy and birth are viewed as normal life processes. Some highlights resulting from midwifery care include: 

Decreased risk of needing a cesarean.
Higher successful vaginal birth after a past cesarean delivery (VBAC).
Less interventions, with increased use of non-pharmaceutical methods of pain and labor management.
Better outcomes for patients facing racial disparities
Better maternal and neonatal health outcomes both during and after pregnancy.


# Is Midwifery right for me?
Midwifery care is best for women who are healthy (no pre-existing conditions that would require continuous monitoring by an MD), who want to be an active participant in their own care, who are committed to preparing for  both their ideal birth and the unexpected.


# What if I need or want an induction?
We can evaluate the pros and cons and your clinical status and come up with a plan together. We are able to conduct an induction in the hospital setting and are also equipped with many tips and tricks to try to get things going in the out of hospital setting if that seems appropriate. Choosing to intervene can change some things about your birth plan so be sure to ask questions and take your time deciding on the best course of action for you. 

# Do I still need a doula if a midwife is providing my prenatal, birth, and postpartum services? Or Do I still need a Doula with Millie? Or What's the difference in a Doula and Midwife?
A doula can still makes sense for you. A midwife is a health care provider similar to an ob. they will come into your labor room intermittently to check on you and be there to deliver your baby. they handle all the medical related issues related to your pregnancy and childbirth. a doula, on the other hand, doesn’t replace your healthcare practitioner or do anything medical associated with your pregnancy/birth. they are there for emotional, physical, and informational support. a doula will likely be with you at home in labor and come with you to the hospital. they will be with you throughout your labor and offer continuous support until a few hours postpartum

# Do you have recommendations or referrals for night nurses ?
We usually refer folks to redwood doulas. they usually have a few doulas providing night support and we have had a handful of clients who have reported a good experience!

# Do you have general recommendations for pediatricians or does Millie have a list of those they like?
You can find our list of recommended pediatricians in the app. Click the "learn" tab and then "experts" {Also provide some results and links from search}

# Do people often still take classes even if they have a doula?
It really depends on how much information the birthing family is wanting + how much education their doula offers. some spend their prenatal sessions with their clients essentially teaching them about the birth process while other doulas focus more on comfort measures and getting to know you

# What is a postpartum doula?
Here is my favorite article on the role of postpartum doulas: https://www.happiestbaby.com/blogs/parents/postpartum-doula

# When will I get my test results?
The results typically come first on the My Health Online App, have you checked there?

# Is there a way to separate the gender results from the rest of test results?
You can let the front desk know you are planning to do a gender reveal so they can separate that information and put it in an envelope for you. 

# Do you have any recommendations for a breast pump? Breast pump recommendations?
Spectra is the most popular pump on the market right now, and we've also had people who used the motif luna with happy results. We recommend checking with your insurance carrier to see which pumps are covered, as well.

# Can you give me more information about doulas, the different types, and the roles they play in my birth?
Oxytocin’s Role:
Here’s a perspective on the birth process that may help you decide if a doula feels like a good fit for your birth team. Labor, at its foundation, is a hormonal process. Oxytocin is the hormone that creates contractions which ultimately result in the delivery of a baby. Oxytocin is a shy hormone. It thrives and works most efficiently when you feel relaxed, confident, safe enough that you feel open to being vulnerable. A question to ask yourself: How are we going to create that environment (both inside of you and in the space around you)? Laboring people are extremely emotionally porous and they pick up the energy and dispositions of those around them very quickly so their support people’s emotions and demeanor are important as well.

Partner Support:
Partners often slip into protector mode, wanting to ensure safety during this intense experience. However, we aim for partners to focus on simply loving and being with you in their unique way. In labor, syncing up, breathing together, and making joint decisions are key for a calm atmosphere fueled by oxytocin. Doulas assist partners in real-time with tools for optimal support, from cultivating a calm demeanor to releasing tension spots. First-time low-risk birthing people might receive guidance to "stay at home as long as possible," even if planning an epidural, which can be stressful and confusing.

At Home:
A birth doula will meet you at your home and help create an environment of calm, peace while helping you and your support team feel confident in the normal processes of labor. Because they have multiple prenatal sessions with you, they will understand your vision and desires of what support looks like for you and when to go to the hospital. 

At Hospital:
Your midwife and nurse team at the hospital will provide physical, emotional, and safety support intermittently. Depending on labor stages, you might see your midwife every few hours and the nurse every 30 mins-2 hours, with solo periods in the labor room. Ask yourself if this enhances relaxation during labor or if continuous doula support is preferable.
Doulas facilitate active participation, fostering a positive birth experience through support, advocacy, and involvement in decision-making. They help you and your support team ask questions, ensuring you advocate for your birth preferences when faced with interventions.

Postpartum Doulas:
Postpartum doulas will help you ease into the transition of new parenthood. They’ll help with troubleshooting issues that may come up, care for your baby when you need a break, do meal prep, assist in helping you nurse and generally be a source of support in your postpartum recovery + help you gain more confidence as a new parent. 

Our experts section in the Millie app has vetted doulas who may be a good fit for you. Please feel free to reach out if you’re looking for additional doula resources.


## Curious if you have any recommendations for prenatal yoga (preferably virtual)?

Yes! For personalized recommendations, message your Millie Guide through the app. They can help you find virtual prenatal yoga options that align with your needs and preferences.

## Can you send me some doula references please? And also can you refresh my memory about what the doula will be providing vs what the midwife will be providing? I’m guessing all doulas and all midwives work slightly differently so I might need to look into specific doulas to see what they offer?

In the Millie app, check out our Expert Network, where you’ll find doulas we regularly refer to and trust. If you have additional questions just message your Millie Guide — they’re happy to help you explore options.

As for the difference between a doula and a midwife:

A midwife is a licensed healthcare provider (like an OB) who manages the medical side of your pregnancy and birth. They’ll come in and out of your labor room to check on you and will be there to deliver your baby. They monitor your vitals, track the baby’s well-being, and address any clinical needs or complications.

A doula isn’t a medical provider and doesn’t replace your midwife or OB. Instead, they offer continuous emotional, physical, and informational support. A doula may start supporting you at home during early labor, then accompany you to the hospital, and stay by your side through labor and into the early postpartum hours — helping with comfort techniques, encouragement, and advocacy throughout the process.

Every doula (and midwife) has their own style and approach, so it’s great to talk to a few and see who feels like the best fit for you. Your Millie Guide can support you in that process too.

## What is a postpartum doula?

postpartum doula is a trained professional who provides physical, emotional, and informational support in the early weeks and months after birth. They often help with infant care, feeding guidance (whether breastfeeding, chestfeeding, or bottle-feeding), and light household tasks—but their support goes far beyond that.

They help you understand what’s expected vs what might fall outside the spectrum of normal, offer evidence-based resources, and refer you to other providers if needed. Their goal is to help ease your transition into parenthood and ensure you feel cared for during this big adjustment. Some doulas also support overnight, helping parents get more rest.

## Can you send me that acupuncture list?

Yes — we do! In the Millie app, check out our Expert Network where you’ll find providers we frequently refer and trust. Feel free to message your Millie Guide if you have additional questions

## Do you have any advice on how to go about making a doula decision? If a doula makes sense for us to hire or how we choose between doulas

In the Millie app, check out our Expert Network, where you’ll find doulas we frequently refer and trust. If you have additional questions just message your Millie Guide and they’ll help you get started.

Here are some helpful things to think through when choosing a doula:

Choose someone whose personality and style feel like a good match. Hiring a doula is as much about connection as it is skill. 

Ask about logistics: How many prenatal visits will we have? When does your on‑call period begin and end? Do you offer backup support if needed? 

Understand how they work with your partner/support person and your care team (midwives/OBs). How do they handle changes in the birth plan or unexpected situations? 

Be clear about what’s included in their services: birth support, postpartum support, visits, text/phone availability, etc. 

Trust your instincts: After meeting them, ask yourself—Do I feel comfortable with this person? Do I believe they’ll be present and responsive when I need them most? 

Each doula is different, and that’s okay. If you aren’t sure which one is right for you, your Millie Guide can help pull a few strong options so you can interview and decide who aligns best with your vision.

## When should I hire a doula?

The earlier you begin your doula search, the better — many doulas book up months in advance, especially in high-demand areas. That said, it’s never too late to find support.

We generally recommend starting your search sometime early in the second trimester. That gives you time to interview a few doulas, reflect on what kind of support you’re looking for, and build a relationship before labor.

You can find trusted doulas in the Expert Network section of the Millie app. If you have additional questions just message your Millie Guide — they’re happy to help.

## Hi, could you share resources for a non medicated birth?

## Do people often still take classes even if they have a doula?

Yes! Many people with doulas still choose to take childbirth education classes. Doulas offer incredible emotional, physical, and informational support, especially during labor—but classes can provide a more structured overview of what to expect, cover different scenarios and decision-making tools, and help prepare both you and your support person(s) ahead of time.

Our classes are designed to complement the support you receive from your doula. They’re evidence-based, practical, and can deepen your understanding of birth, postpartum, and beyond. If you’re unsure which class is the best fit, feel free to message your Millie Guide or explore our offerings here: millieclinic.com/services/wraparound-support

Feel free to message your Millie Guide if you’re unsure how to proceed!

## What water temperature is the limit for a safe pool/bath time? Can I get in the hot tub?

Generally, yes — it’s okay to enjoy a warm bath or time in the pool while pregnant. The biggest concerns are:

Temperature: Avoid hot water that raises your core body temperature above 102°F (38.9°C), especially in the first trimester. Prolonged overheating can pose risks to the developing fetus. This means most hot tubs, saunas, and very hot baths are not advised unless the temperature is adjustable and kept below 100°F. Warm baths and pools (even heated ones) are usually fine as long as they don’t feel uncomfortably hot and you’re not overheating.

Cleanliness: Public hot tubs or pools can pose a higher risk of infection if they’re not well-maintained. Private settings with good hygiene are generally safer.

Chemicals and Soaps: Some pools or bath additives may contain harsh chemicals or fragrances that could irritate sensitive skin during pregnancy. Opt for gentler, pregnancy-safe options when possible.

We’re not trying to fear-monger — many people continue using baths or pools throughout pregnancy without issue. Just be mindful of temperature, duration, and setting.

Please note: This is general guidance. For personalized medical advice, we always recommend sending your midwife a message through My Health Online.

## Are digestive enzymes safe to take during pregnancy to help with constipation?

Some digestive enzyme supplements may be helpful during pregnancy, though it's important to check the ingredients. A few contain added herbs or other components that aren’t always recommended in pregnancy. For constipation, we usually focus first on hydration, fiber, magnesium, movement, and reviewing your prenatal.

Please message your midwife on My Health Online for personalized advice based on your health and pregnancy.

## Is there a handout or fillable PDF for Birth Preferences?
Yes! Here's the link: https://my.millieclinic.com/birth-prefs

## Is it ok to take tylenol? Can I take tylenol?

Yes Tylenol is generally considered safe during pregnancy when taken as directed. For dosage guidelines and more over-the-counter options, check out our Pregnancy Self Care 101 guide in your My Care Toolkit. If you’re unsure or dealing with specific symptoms, send your midwife a message in MyChart (My Health Online).

## Is it ok to take zicam? Can I take zicam?

Zicam products often contain ingredients that haven’t been well studied in pregnant populations, we don’t actively recommend it. That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s dangerous — we just don’t have enough information to confidently say yes or no.

If you’re thinking about taking it, it’s best to check in with your midwife through My Health Online.

For other ideas, take a look at our Pregnancy Self-Care 101 guide in your Millie care toolkit — it includes safe suggestions for colds, congestion, nausea, and more.

## Is it ok to take dayquil/nyquil? Can I take dayquil or nyquil?

Cold and flu medications like DayQuil and NyQuil contain a mix of ingredients, some of which may not be recommended during pregnancy. Because of that, we suggest reaching out to your Millie midwife via the My health online before taking these. In the meantime, check out Pregnancy Self-Care 101 in your care toolkit on the app for tips on staying comfortable when you're sick.

## Is it ok to take zofran? Can I take zofran?

Zofran may be used in pregnancy in certain cases, but it's not always the first choice. Some studies raise concerns, especially early in pregnancy, so it’s something to talk through with your midwife. Please send them a message on My Health Online to discuss what’s best for you. You can also check out our Pregnancy Self-Care 101 guide in your care toolkit on the app for other nausea relief options.

## Is lions mane mushroom or mushroom supplements safe for pregnancy?

We don’t have enough solid research to say for certain. While Lion’s Mane and reishi mushrooms are generally recognized as safe when eaten as food, the supplement form is more concentrated and hasn’t been well‑studied for pregnancy. If you’re considering it, it’s best to send your midwife a message on My Health Online for personalized guidance.

## I was wondering if raspberry leaf tea is safe to take in pregnancy and if so, when should I take it?

Raspberry leaf tea is generally considered safe later in pregnancy, and many midwives use it or advise starting it around the 32‑34 week mark. 
PMC
That said, the research is limited, and we really don’t know enough to say it should be used early on in pregnancy or for every pregnancy. 
If you’re thinking about using it — or have questions about when it might make sense for you — please send your midwife a message on My Health Online.

## Wondering if it’s safe to take melatonin? What about if it has other ingredients like GABA?

Melatonin hasn’t been well studied in pregnancy, and the same goes for GABA. While some early research suggests melatonin may be safe, there isn’t enough evidence to say for sure. If your melatonin supplement contains other ingredients (like GABA), it’s especially important to check in with your provider before taking it.

## What can I use to treat a yeast infection?

If you think you may have a vaginal yeast infection during pregnancy:

Over-the-counter vaginal creams or suppositories with clotrimazole or miconazole used for 7 days are generally considered safe. 

Oral treatments (pills) like fluconazole are not generally recommended in pregnancy due to potential risks. 

Because symptoms can be similar to other infections, it’s always best to message your midwife on My Health Online first, so you get the right diagnosis and treatment.

## Is it ok to get my covid and flu vaccines?

Yes getting both the flu and COVID‑19 vaccines (or their updated versions) during pregnancy is considered safe and beneficial. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), these vaccines are not harmful for pregnant people or their babies. 

In fact, receiving them can help protect you from serious illness and also offer some protection to your baby. 
CDC

If you’re unsure or have questions about timing, please send your midwife a message on My Health Online for personalized medical advice.

## I’ve noticed that the baby is less active than she was before, and I’ve noticed a lot of tightness in my belly off and on. I’m pretty sure these are just Braxton hicks, but I wanted to check to make sure everything is okay

It’s totally normal to have some changes in movement patterns as your pregnancy progresses, and many people start to feel more tightening sensations (often Braxton Hicks) in the third trimester. That said, if you're ever noticing a decrease in fetal movement or aren’t sure, we definitely want you to check in with your midwife to be safe. Please call the clinic and press 1 to speak with the on call midwife so they can walk you through next steps. They might ask you to do a kick count or come in to check on things—just to make sure all is well.

## Do you have any thoughts on ashwaganda?

There’s not enough strong research to say for sure. Because of the limited data, most providers suggest not taking ashwagandha while pregnant or breastfeeding. If you’re thinking about it, please send your midwife a message on My Health Online for personalized guidance.

## wondering if it is safe for me to take Culturelle probiotics?

Probiotics are generally considered safe in pregnancy, but formulas can vary and some include ingredients not recommended. We don’t have enough data to say for sure that every version is safe — so it’s best to message your midwife on My Health Online for personalized guidance.

## I wanted to start the Valacyclovir at 36 weeks so I was wondering if I could get that sent to my pharmacy.

Please message your midwife through My Health Online for any prescriptions or medication-related requests. They’ll be able to get that process started for you if it's clinically appropriate.

## I have questions on SSRIs during pregnancy and looking to start one. Is this something you can help with or should I go thru my health online?

It’s best to reach out to your midwife directly through My Health Online to discuss starting or continuing any prescription medication like SSRIs. They can talk through your symptoms, review your history, and help decide what’s safest and most supportive for you during pregnancy.

## Would it be safe for me to drink herbal tea

Some herbal teas, like ginger or peppermint, can be helpful during pregnancy. Others may not be recommended depending on the ingredients and your unique situation.

Every pregnancy is different — what’s supportive for some may not be right for others. If you’re curious about a specific tea or ingredient, it’s a good idea to send your midwife a message on My Health Online. You can also check out the Pregnancy Self Care 101 guide in your My Care Toolkit for general suggestions.

## Is it safe to use ICYHOT or arnica cream for muscle pain during pregnancy?'

It depends, and a quick message to your midwife on My Health Online is the best way to get a clear answer for your body and your pregnancy.
That said, here’s some general info:
Many care teams are okay with occasional use of IcyHot or arnica cream in small amounts, especially away from your belly.
Arnica taken by mouth isn’t recommended in pregnancy, but topical creams haven’t been shown to cause harm when used as directed.
With both, we’re just cautious because research is limited — not because we’ve seen major issues.
Every pregnancy is different, and sometimes even something that’s generally fine might not be ideal for you. When in doubt, your midwife is just a message away

## Quick question, is there a belly band brand that you would recommend?

Great question! I don’t have a single brand that works for everyone, because fit and comfort vary so much from person to person. My biggest tip: pick one with a good return policy so you can try it and see how it feels without committing.

Feel free to check in with your midwife by sending them a message on My Health Online if you’re experiencing pain or discomfort and want help narrowing down features.

## Is it ok for me to take melatonin for sleep while pregnant ?

Melatonin is commonly used for sleep, and many providers feel comfortable with it during pregnancy—especially for short-term or occasional use. That said, research on long-term use in pregnancy is still limited, so it’s always a good idea to check in with your midwife on My Health Online to talk through your sleep needs and make sure it’s the right fit for you.

## Do you have any recommendations on a perineal oil that we can use for massages?

There are several options that may work well for perineal massage! Common choices include olive oil, vitamin E oil, coconut oil (though some find it a bit gritty), or even unscented personal lubricant. Evening primrose oil is also becoming more popular and is being studied for its benefits in late pregnancy. Every body is different, so go with something that feels good and doesn’t irritate your skin.

## is it safe to travel domestically when pregnant?

Every pregnancy is different, so we encourage you to talk to your Millie clinician about your specific travel plans. For the majority of uncomplicated pregnancies, travel through 36 weeks is generally considered safe. However, international airlines often limit travel after 32–33 weeks, so it’s a good idea to check before booking!

FOR LONG DISTANCE TRAVEL HERE ARE SOME GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS:

Wear compression stockings, knee-high

Hydratebefore, during, and after travel

Stretch every several hours on prolonged flights

## Do you have prenatal vitamin recommendations?

I don’t have one brand to recommend for everyone, because your nutrition, health history, and needs are unique. What I can suggest: look for a prenatal vitamin that has at least folic acid, iron, iodine, vitamin D and DHA/omega‑3s — those are key.

And if you’re unsure which one to pick or if your current one is a good fit, it’s a great idea to send your midwife a message on My Health Online so we can help you figure it out together.

## I tested positive for covid and have all the symptoms. what can i take to help me with covid? can you prescribe me medicine?

Please send your midwife a message right away so we can review your case, discuss prescription options if needed, and ensure you get the right care.
In the meantime, for mild symptoms at home: rest, stay hydrated, use acetaminophen for fever or aches (with provider approval), and monitor symptoms closely.

## Can I sleep on my right side or should I only try to sleep on my left side? Is it ok if I wake up on my back?

Great question—and the good news is: you don’t need to stress if you wake up on your back or if you prefer your right side.
Sleeping on your side (either side) is generally recommended in pregnancy, especially in the second and third trimesters, to support circulation.
Left side is slightly preferred because it may optimize blood flow to the uterus and baby, but right side is also safe and commonly recommended as a good option.
If you wake up on your back, there’s no need to panic. Just gently shift to your side when you notice.
Many providers encourage a “sleep on your side when you can” approach—it’s not about perfection, it’s about positioning that supports you and your baby.
If you ever feel dizzy or lightheaded lying on your back, that’s a good cue to shift positions. And if you're ever unsure, feel free to send your midwife a message

## Can I use cbd oil topically in pregnancy?

While there’s limited research on the use of CBD oil during pregnancy, especially when applied topically, most experts take a cautious approach due to the lack of safety data. We still don’t know enough about how it might affect pregnancy or fetal development.
Some people do choose to use topical CBD during pregnancy for issues like soreness or inflammation, but it's a good idea to talk with your provider before using it.
If you're looking for alternatives for muscle aches or skin irritation, we’re happy to help you explore other pregnancy-safe options too.

## how much are newborns are at risk, between what weeks/months of age, for being around unvaccinated adults?

Newborns and young infants are more vulnerable to certain illnesses. Because they haven’t yet developed full immunity or received many of their vaccines, they depend on those around them for protection. 

Here are a few things to keep in mind:

Babies under about 6 months of age are at higher risk for serious illness from infections like the flu, COVID‑19, or whooping cough and unvaccinated adults around them can increase that risk. 

The best way to protect your baby is by forming what’s often called a “circle of protection” — meaning those who spend time with the baby should be up‑to‑date on vaccines, stay home when sick, wash their hands, and follow the boundary rules you feel comfortable with. 

A helpful question to ask yourself with your partner or support team: What are our comfort levels and boundaries? Decide ahead of time:

Are we asking visitors to be vaccinated?
Should they wash their hands or wear a mask around the baby?
Can they hold or kiss the baby?
Are there certain people we’re asking to wait before holding the baby?
These decisions are yours to make and doing it ahead of time can help you feel more prepared once baby is here.

We also have a Postpartum Plan Worksheet you can use to guide conversations around boundaries, support systems, and visitor policies.

## what specific kinds of high impact exercise are suitable in pregnancy?

I'm glad to hear your energy is coming back. for most low risk pregnant folks, running, aerobics, jumping activities are considered safe through most of pregnancy. Check in with your provider if you have any safety questions!

## I am 20 weeks as of today and still at my pre pregnancy weight. is that normal?

This is definitely something your midwife or provider can speak to more personally and we always recommend reaching out to them if you’re unsure or want guidance specific to your pregnancy.

That said, there’s a wide range of normal when it comes to weight gain in pregnancy.

What’s typically recommended:

Most providers reference general guidelines that suggest gaining 20–40 pounds over the course of pregnancy, depending on your body type, BMI, and other factors. But this is just a general range (not a one-size-fits-all rule) and it doesn’t account for how individual bodies change over time.

What we commonly see:

Some people gain early in the first trimester, while others don’t notice a shift until mid or late pregnancy.
It’s also common to maintain your pre-pregnancy weight until around 20–24 weeks, especially if you’ve had nausea or food aversions.
Some folks gain very gradually throughout, and others see more of a jump in the third trimester.
A few don’t gain much at all - especially if they began pregnancy in a higher BMI category — and their providers may still consider things to be progressing normally as long as baby is growing and the birthing parent is well-nourished.

What matters most:
Rather than focusing solely on the number on the scale, we encourage people to prioritize:

Nourishment and hydration
Balanced meals (even small ones if you’ve had nausea)
Movement, if it feels good to your body
Regular check-ins with your provider to monitor baby’s growth and your overall health

If you're ever unsure, checking in with your midwife is the best next step — they’ll take into account your full picture, including labs, fundal height, ultrasound results, and how you’re feeling overall.

## Can I eat sushi?

It’s understandable to feel unsure about sushi during pregnanc. It’s often on the “do not eat” lists. The real concern isn’t sushi itself, but the small risk of foodborne illness like listeria or parasites. That risk is low if you're eating at a clean, reputable place that serves high quality sushi-grade fish.

That said, if eating raw fish feels stressful or makes you anxious, it's okay to skip it for peace of mind. And of course, avoid high-mercury fish like swordfish or king mackerel. Cooked rolls are always a safer alternative.

If you're unsure, check in with your midwife. They can help you weigh your options based on your comfort and health.

## Is it safe to go on a boat at 35 weeks pregnant ?

There’s no rule that says you can’t go boating late in pregnancy — but at 35 weeks, it’s wise to take a few extra precautions. Each pregnancy is unique, so messaging your midwife is always your best source of guidance.

Here are some things to keep in mind:

Stick to calm waters and stable boats. A short, relaxed rowboat ride or a quick ferry trip on flat water may feel totally fine. Cruises and longer trips with more motion or time away from medical care might require a little more planning.

Stay close to land and medical support. If you were to go into labor or feel unwell, you’d want help to be nearby. This is especially true if you’ve had any complications during pregnancy.

Prioritize comfort and safety. Wear a well-fitting life jacket, stay hydrated, avoid lifting heavy items, wear flat non-slip shoes, and build in time to rest.

Consider the physical impact. Even just balancing or standing on a rocking surface can feel harder late in pregnancy, so tune into what your body is telling you.

Talk it through with your care team. If you’re not sure what’s best for your situation, message your midwife through My Health Online before heading out. They can help you weigh your options.

Bottom line: There’s very little formal research about boating in late pregnancy, and for many people, it’s just fine. But thinking about the setting, the type of boat, and your own comfort and safety can help you make a call that feels right for you.

## Can pregnant woman can drink hibiscus teas/drinks?

Hibiscus is often labeled “controversial” in pregnancy, but here’s what we know:
The caution mostly comes from animal studies where very large doses of hibiscus extract were given to mice. These doses don’t reflect what someone would get from a typical tea or beverage — you’d have to consume a lot of concentrated hibiscus to come close.

In real life, most OBs and midwives don’t advise avoiding the occasional cup of hibiscus tea or a hibiscus-flavored drink. That said, since research is limited and some sources raise theoretical concerns, it’s a good idea to keep it in moderation and check in with your provider if you’re unsure.

When in doubt, send your provider a message to get their stance.

## Is it safe to go to an imax movie theater?

There’s very little research on this, but here’s what we do know:
Theoretical concerns have been raised about prolonged exposure to loud noises during pregnancy (especially above 85 decibels), since the fetus begins to hear sounds around 18–20 weeks. In extreme cases, repeated exposure to high-volume noise could possibly affect fetal hearing development — but most one-time experiences, like a movie, are considered low risk.

IMAX theaters can be louder than standard ones, but a single movie is unlikely to cause harm. If you're worried, consider sitting further from the speakers or avoiding especially action-heavy films.

Most importantly, follow your body’s cues — if the environment feels overstimulating, take a break or step outside. And if you have any specific concerns, feel free to message your provider.

## Do you have any recommendations related to nettle tea? i have heard it can be beneficial during pregnancy. Are there other pregnancy teas I should be consuming?

Nettle tea is a popular herbal option during pregnancy, especially in the second and third trimesters. It's known for being rich in minerals like iron and calcium, but clinical studies on its use in pregnancy are limited. Many midwives and herbalists consider it generally safe when consumed in moderation, especially if you’re using a tea blend designed for pregnancy. That said, because herbs can have strong effects on the body, it’s always a good idea to run it by your midwife.

Other teas often used in pregnancy include red raspberry leaf (commonly in the third trimester), ginger (for nausea), chamomile (for relaxation), and peppermint (for digestive support). Always check the ingredient list, especially with blends, and avoid teas marketed as “detox” or “weight loss.”

As always, if you’re curious about trying an herbal tea, we recommend messaging your midwife so they can tailor their advice to you and your pregnancy.

## Do you have lactation supplement recommendations

Lactation supplements include herbs like fenugreek, goat’s rue, torbangun, moringa, and shatavari, as well as blends marketed to help increase milk supply. Some people find them helpful, but the research is mixed and results can vary from person to person.

We recommend speaking with a lactation consultant before starting any supplements. Many supply issues are rooted in feeding patterns, latch, or pumping schedules, and those things are often more impactful than supplements alone. A lactation professional can help you figure out what’s going on and whether a supplement might be helpful as part of your plan.

Also, keep in mind that some herbs can cause side effects or impact milk oversupply, and not all products are well-regulated or evidence-based. We suggest prioritizing things like frequent milk removal (nursing or pumping), hydration, nutrition, and rest—and reaching out to a lactation consultant if you need support.

## what do you think of beef liver supplements?

Some midwives and traditional medicine practitioners are strong advocates of beef liver or organ supplements in pregnancy because of their high levels of iron, B vitamins, and other nutrients. Others, including many OBs, are more cautious because beef liver is high in preformed vitamin A (retinol), which may be risky in large amounts during pregnancy.
Because every body and pregnancy is different, it's best to check in with your midwife before adding beef liver and organ supplements to your routine. They’ll help you weigh the potential benefits and any risks in your particular case.

## car seat inspection/registration - is this mandatory and also where do we go for this?

Registration: You should register your car seat with the manufacturer so you’ll get recall alerts. It’s not always legally required, but strongly recommended.

Inspection: Having your car seat checked by a certified technician is not always required by law, but it’s a smart move. Many fire departments, police stations, health departments, and child‑safety organizations offer free or low‑cost seat‑check events or one‑on‑one appointments. 

Where to go:
Search for “car seat inspection” + your city/county.
Call your local fire or police department—they often host or partner with inspection programs. 

Use national resources like the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) inspection‑station directory for certified technicians.

## What are your thoughts on using liquid iv or other electrolyte powders as a hydration supplement?

Yes electrolytes are generally fine in moderation and can be helpful if you're dehydrated from nausea, vomiting, exercise, or heat. That said, many popular options (like Liquid IV) contain added sugar and high sodium, so it’s a good idea to check the label and choose versions with lower amounts if possible.

Water should still be your hydration baseline, but if electrolytes help you stay hydrated, especially during tough stretches, they can be a good tool. If you have high blood pressure or any underlying conditions, it's worth checking in with your provider before adding them regularly.

## Is topical retinol safe while pregnant and/or breastfeeding?

Retinol is generally not recommended during pregnancy.

Even though only a small amount is absorbed through the skin, there just isn’t enough research to confirm it's totally safe during pregnancy. Because of this, most providers recommend skipping retinol while you're pregnant to be on the safe side.

When it comes to nursing, the concern shifts a bit. It’s unlikely that much retinol passes into human milk, but there’s still a chance your baby could come into contact with it through skin-to-skin — especially if it's applied to areas like your chest, arms, or shoulders. For that reason, many providers recommend holding off on retinol while nursing, too, or choosing safer alternatives.

If you're looking for pregnancy- or lactation-safe skincare options, send a message to your midwife — they’re happy to help!

## Is nausea and vomiting normal during the second trimester?

It’s common for nausea and vomiting to improve after the first trimester, but not everyone follows the same timeline. Some people do continue to experience symptoms into the second trimester—or even throughout pregnancy. If the nausea feels like it’s getting worse, interfering with eating or hydration, or if you're losing weight, it’s a good idea to check in with your provider. They can help rule out anything more serious and talk through options for relief.
