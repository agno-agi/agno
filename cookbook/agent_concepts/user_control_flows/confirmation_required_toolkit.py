"""ü§ù Human-in-the-Loop: Adding User Confirmation to Tool Calls

This example shows how to implement human-in-the-loop functionality in your Agno tools.
It shows how to:
- Handle user confirmation during tool execution
- Gracefully cancel operations based on user choice

Some practical applications:
- Confirming sensitive operations before execution
- Reviewing API calls before they're made
- Validating data transformations
- Approving automated actions in critical systems

Run `pip install openai httpx rich agno` to install dependencies.
