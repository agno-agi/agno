"""Example for AgentOS to show how to generate custom events.

You can yield custom events from your own tools. These events will be handled internally as an Agno event, and you will be able to access it in the same way you would access any other Agno event.

In this example we also pass the session state to the tool, so that the tool can use it to get the customer profile.
