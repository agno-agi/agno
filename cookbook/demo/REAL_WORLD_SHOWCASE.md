## API Usage

### Basic Agent Call

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:7780/agents/personal-finance-manager/run" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": "What is the current price of AAPL?"}'
```

### Team Call

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:7780/teams/customer-support-team/run" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": "I need help with my account"}'
```

### Workflow Call

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:7780/workflows/content-creation-pipeline/run" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": "AI in education"}'
```

### Streaming Response

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:7780/agents/education-tutor/run" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": "Explain machine learning", "stream": true}'
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# API Keys (optional for demo)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key

# Database (auto-created)
AGNO_DB_PATH=tmp/real_world.db

# LanceDB (auto-created)
LANCEDB_PATH=tmp/lancedb
```

### Custom Configuration

Edit `workspace/config/config.yaml` to customize:
- Model parameters
- Tool configurations
- Memory settings
- Hook behaviors

## Performance Considerations

### Resource Usage

- **Memory**: ~500MB-1GB depending on knowledge bases
- **Startup Time**: ~10-15 seconds for knowledge base loading
- **Response Time**:
  - Simple agents: 2-5 seconds
  - Teams: 10-20 seconds
  - Workflows: 20-40 seconds

### Optimization Tips

1. **Pre-load knowledge bases** for faster first response
2. **Use streaming** for long-running operations
3. **Implement caching** for repeated queries
4. **Monitor token usage** to control costs

## Production Deployment

### Scaling Recommendations

```yaml
agents:
  - Horizontal scaling with load balancer
  - Separate instances for different use cases
  - Cache frequently accessed knowledge

databases:
  - Move from SQLite to PostgreSQL
  - Implement connection pooling
  - Add read replicas for scalability

monitoring:
  - Add Prometheus metrics
  - Implement distributed tracing
  - Set up error alerting
```

### Security Considerations

- **API Keys**: Use secrets management (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement per-user rate limits
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated via pre-hooks
- **Output Sanitization**: Sensitive data is filtered in post-hooks
- **Authentication**: Add OAuth2/JWT for production

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: Knowledge base loading fails

```bash
# Check for OpenAI API key
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY

# Verify URL accessibility
curl -I https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html
```

#### Issue: Port already in use

```bash
# Find process using port 7780
lsof -i :7780

# Kill the process
kill -9 <PID>
```

#### Issue: Out of memory

```bash
# Reduce knowledge base size
# Or increase system memory
# Or disable unused agents
```

## Development

### Adding a New Use Case

1. **Define the agent/team**:
```python
my_agent = Agent(
    name="My Agent",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    tools=[...],
    instructions=[...],
)
```

2. **Add to AgentOS**:
```python
agent_os = AgentOS(
    agents=[..., my_agent],
)
```

3. **Test**:
```bash
python cookbook/demo/real_world_showcase.py
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests (if available)
pytest tests/

# Integration tests
python -m cookbook.demo.real_world_showcase
```
