        Python Programming Fundamentals:

        Variables and Data Types:
        - Variables store data values (numbers, strings, lists)
        - Use descriptive names (user_name, not x)
        - Python is dynamically typed (no type declaration needed)

        Control Flow:
        - if/elif/else for conditional logic
        - for loops iterate over sequences
        - while loops continue until condition is False
        - break exits loops early, continue skips iteration

        Functions:
        - Functions organize reusable code blocks
        - Define with def function_name(parameters):
        - Return values with return statement
        - Functions can have default parameter values

        Data Structures:
        - Lists: Ordered, mutable sequences [1, 2, 3]
        - Tuples: Ordered, immutable sequences (1, 2, 3)
        - Dictionaries: Key-value pairs {"name": "John"}
        - Sets: Unordered unique values {1, 2, 3}

        Best Practices:
        - Write clear, readable code with comments
        - Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
        - Handle errors with try/except blocks
        - Test your code thoroughly
        - Break complex problems into smaller functions

        Common Beginner Mistakes:
        - Forgetting colons after if/for/while/def statements
        - Incorrect indentation (use 4 spaces)
        - Modifying lists while iterating over them
        - Not handling exceptions properly
