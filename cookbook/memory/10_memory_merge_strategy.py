"""
Memory optimization using the "merge" strategy.

The "merge" strategy combines all memories into a single comprehensive summary,
achieving maximum compression. This is useful when you need aggressive token
reduction and can accept losing the individual memory structure.

Run: python cookbook/memory/10_memory_merge_strategy.py
