"""
Creating a custom memory optimization strategy.

This cookbook shows how to create your own memory optimization strategy by
subclassing MemoryOptimizationStrategy. This is useful when you need custom
logic that the built-in "summarize" and "merge" strategies don't provide.

Run: python cookbook/memory/11_custom_memory_strategy.py
