"""ðŸ”§ Example: Using the OpenAITools Toolkit for Image Generation

This script demonstrates how to use the `OpenAITools` toolkit, which includes a tool for generating images using OpenAI's DALL-E within an Agno Agent.

Example prompts to try:
- "Create a surreal painting of a floating city in the clouds at sunset"
- "Generate a photorealistic image of a cozy coffee shop interior"
- "Design a cute cartoon mascot for a tech startup"
- "Create an artistic portrait of a cyberpunk samurai"

Run `pip install openai agno` to install the necessary dependencies.
