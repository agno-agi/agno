"""ðŸ”Š Example: Using the OpenAITools Toolkit for Text-to-Speech

This script demonstrates how to use the `generate_speech` tool within the
`OpenAITools` toolkit, integrated with an Agno Agent.

It sets up an agent with an OpenAI model (`gpt-4o`) and the `OpenAITools`
toolkit, then asks the agent to synthesize speech from a given text input
and save it to a specified audio file.

Run `pip install openai agno` to install the necessary dependencies.
