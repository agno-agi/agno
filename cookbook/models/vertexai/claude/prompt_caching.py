"""
This cookbook shows how to use prompt caching with Agents using Anthropic models, to catch the system prompt passed to the model.

This can significantly reduce processing time and costs.
Use it when working with a static and large system prompt.

You can check more about prompt caching with Anthropic models here: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/prompt-caching

Note: It takes a few seconds for the cache to be created and used for the second run.
