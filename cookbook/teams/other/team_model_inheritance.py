"""
This example demonstrates how agents automatically inherit the model from their Team when not explicitly set.

This is particularly useful when:
- Using non-OpenAI models (Claude, Ollama, VLLM, etc.) to avoid manual model configuration on every agent
- Preventing API key errors when team uses a different provider than the default OpenAI
- Simplifying code by setting the model once on the team instead of on each agent

Key behaviors:
1. Agents without explicit models inherit from their team
2. Agents with explicit models keep their own configuration
3. Nested teams and their members inherit from their immediate parent team
4. All model types are inherited: model, reasoning_model, parser_model, output_model
