"""üìÅ Qdrant MCP Agent - Your Personal Knowledge Base Assistant!

This example demonstrates how to create a knowledge base agent that uses MCP to interact with a Qdrant vector database.
The agent leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to store and retrieve information, allowing it to remember conversations
and build a persistent knowledge base.

Example prompts to try:
- "What is the difference between deep learning and machine learning?"
- "Tell me about natural language processing"
- "What are the applications of computer vision?"

Run: `pip install agno mcp openai` to install the dependencies

Export the following environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export QDRANT_API_KEY="..."
```
