"""ðŸ—½ Demonstration how to use the google search cache
This example uses a cache to store the results of the google or Duck Duck Go search.
based on 02_agent_with_tools.py
This example follows the same logic.
We use mistral as the model and ddg or google as the search tool.
During developement, you will probably hit the rate limit of the Duck Duck go or the google search API.
This example uses a cache to store the results of the google search.
You also need a postgres database on port 5532

Run `pip install dotenv googlesearch agno sqlalchemy pycountry mistralai` to install dependencies.
