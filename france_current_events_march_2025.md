As of March 13, 2025, here are the latest developments in France:

**Economic Outlook**

The Banque de France has revised its 2025 growth forecast downward to 0.7%, citing trade tensions that have dampened demand for French exports. This is a decrease from the previous estimate of 0.9%. The central bank anticipates that improved business investments will boost growth to 1.2% in 2026 and 1.3% in 2027. Inflation is projected to rise gradually, reaching 1.9% by 2027.

**Political Developments**

In December 2024, the French government led by Prime Minister Michel Barnier collapsed following a successful vote of no confidence in the National Assembly. This marked the first time since 1962 that a French cabinet was toppled by Parliament. President Emmanuel Macron accepted Barnier's resignation but vowed to remain in office until the end of his term in 2027.

**Social Issues**
