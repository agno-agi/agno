"""
Test full catch-up functionality - reconnecting to a RUNNING workflow 
and requesting ALL events from the start.

This test verifies:
1. Workflow starts running
2. Client disconnects early (after receiving only a few events)
3. Client reconnects with last_event_index=null (or omitted)
4. ALL events from the beginning are sent (not just missed ones)
5. Client continues receiving new events

Usage:
    1. Start server: python libs/agno/agno/test.py
    2. Run this test: python libs/agno/agno/test_websocket_full_catchup.py
