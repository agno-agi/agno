        Use this tool to make an edit to an existing file using Morph's Fast Apply API.

        This will be read by Morph's specialized model, which will quickly apply the edit with 98% accuracy.
        You should make it clear what the edit is, while also minimizing the unchanged code you write.
        When writing the edit, you should specify each edit in sequence, with the special comment 
        // ... existing code ... to represent unchanged code in between edited lines.

        For example:

        // ... existing code ...
        FIRST_EDIT
        // ... existing code ...
        SECOND_EDIT
        // ... existing code ...
        THIRD_EDIT
        // ... existing code ...

        You should still bias towards repeating as few lines of the original file as possible to convey the change.
        But, each edit should contain sufficient context of unchanged lines around the code you're editing to resolve ambiguity.
        DO NOT omit spans of pre-existing code (or comments) without using the // ... existing code ... comment to indicate its absence.

        Args:
            target_file: The target file to modify
            instructions: A single sentence instruction describing what you are going to do for the sketched edit. 
                         Use the first person to describe what you are going to do. 
                         Example: "I am adding error handling to the user authentication function"
            code_edit: Specify ONLY the precise lines of code that you wish to edit. 
                      Use // ... existing code ... to represent unchanged code.
            original_code: The complete original code. If not provided, will read from target_file.

        Returns:
            A message indicating success and the final merged code.
